measure of precision
more the noise , less is precision...more the spread axis,more is precision
These standard errors can be used to compute confidence
intervals. A 95% confidence interval is defined as a range of
values such that with 95% probability, the range will
contain the true unknown value of the parameter.
Residual Standard error:
RSE=sqrt(RSS/(n-2))
Total sum of squares:-
TSS=sigma(sq(yi-mean(y)))
R-squared (fraction of variance):-
R2=(TSS-RSS)/TSS

F-statistic:used to find whether any of the predictors are useful in predicting the response.More the better

fit plane

p-value greater than approx 0.1 is not significant
greater the t-statistic , more the important/significant the parameter is

choosing correct parameters:-
1.all subset eval
2.Forward selection
3.Backward selection

Qualitative Predictors:-dummy variables introduced.
level with no dummy variable is called baseline
baseline does not effect model

interactions and non linearity
synergy,interaction
