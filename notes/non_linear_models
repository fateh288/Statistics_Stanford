leverage-information at the end of curve is less , standard error is more.
Select dimension d either ranfdom small value or do cross validation.
To get confidence intervals, compute upper and lower bounds nd then invert to get on probability scale.
Caveat-polynomials have a tail behaviour- very bad for extrapolation.

Step Functions-Piece wise constant functions--No dirrect non linearities-Smooth alternatives aree available--eg splines
Piecewise polynomials-smooth and local
Natural cubic splines-extra functions at boundary-linearities at boundary- helps in extrapolation.
Cubic spline with k knots-k+4 deg of freedom
Natural spline with k knots-k deg of freedom
Knot placement
Smoothing Splines:
Roughness penalty-lambda=0 => extrapolating function , lambda=infinity => linear function

Local Regression-fit locally while moving region of interest.

Generalized Additive models:-
allows for flexible non linearities in several varibles ,  but retains additive structure of linear models.---coefficient not interesting, fitted functions are useful.

Summary-
Ways to add non linearities:Spline terms,polynomial terms,interactions,step functions

Every function in the basis must be continuous at t, and we must be able to represent any piecewise linear function with a single knot at t as a linear combination of the functions in the basis.

If there is an interaction between X1 and X2, a purely additive model can never capture it.
